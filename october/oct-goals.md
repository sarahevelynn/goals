SMART Goals for 10/19/17 Today I want to accomplish a few things: Goal 1: Ensure all my drills I submitted are 100% correct and I understand where I messed up and the reason what I did was incorrect by the end of the day. If I do not understand this, I will reach out for help.

Goal 2: My second goal is to plan all the meetups that I currently access to I think would be beneficial to me for the next month.

Goal 3: Work dilligently on all of the soft skills work. Keep my mind focused and complete the drills by EoD. If this requires work after the mentor night, do it. Have all of these drills understood, notes taken and accomplished. This includes updating previous drills if need be.
