Goal 4: Over the weekend I want to fix my computer problem. This means staying calm, cool and collected when at the store and trying to best explain everything that happened. This means accepting the outcome of whatever happens and moving on from it. This also means taking it as a learning experience, and continuing to try to laugh about it.
