 SMART for 10/27  Today I want to accomplish a few things:
1. I want to finish all of my html and css drills and make the appropriate corrections. I also want to understand the issues I made and how I can fix them.
2. I want to watch and understand the intro to programing video and start that practice and the drills. I may have an issue with my console or it is user error because that is what I thought was my issue during pre-course.
3. I want to get my second and third learn to learns done this weekend so I can finish up the soft skills. I want to ensure that I do them on effective things that actually add value for me. Thinking of doing one on page placement (grid and flex) and one on programming.
4. Get myself to a point where I am confident in what I have been working on and if I am not, figure out what I need to do over the weekend.  
5. Finally, plan out my meetups. I need to go to them. I want to go to two next week so I can catchup from being behind with them due to life stuff.


Refection on goals for the day: Oct 10/20
Goal one: I did a good job with this. Luckily I did not make many mistakes, most of them were formatting. This is important and kind of funny because I am a crazy person when it come to being organized I am usually a crazy person about it. I think I was just too excited and trying to get through it all, and I should not be doing that.
Sloppy work is a problem and definitely one I do not want to have. I also did a good job of understanding why not to use breaks for formatting and through doing so, understood a lot more about grid than I had before. Grid was hard for me because I followed it in a tutorial for the pre-course work and did not fully comprehend what I was doing which made me even more confused when I did try to do it.

Goal two: Java and those things are difficult for me, and trying to figure it out via the video and struggling over the weekend did not help. I got myself into quite the upset and decided to just let it be until class today when I could get help and try to understand what is happening with the help of others. It was not productive for me to keep being upset about it as I was only inhibiting my ability to learn.

Goal three: I finished these up and was just having trouble uploading them because it says the files are too big. Will have to figure out what is going on with that in class as looking at what to do online was not productive or helpful.

Goal four: I got there, but attempting to work on the stuff over the weekend was counter productive as I was getting upset and overwhelmed trying to figure out Javascript and was not in the correct mindset to try to be doing it due to other life pressures and issues. This week I will dive into it and try to figure it out.

Goal five: I think I have done well with the planning. I found quite a few that I am interested in and have RSVPed to. I am disappointed that I haven't been going to them the last two weeks, but cannot imagine trying to do that with everything that has been going on in my life personally. I spent the weekend sifting through the many issues I have been dealing with and think I got myself into the position to be able to have piece of mind this week and be able to focus on school and not have to deal with other stuff.
