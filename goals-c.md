 SMART for 10/27  Today I want to accomplish a few things:
1. I want to finish all of my html and css drills and make the appropriate corrections. I also want to understand the issues I made and how I can fix them.
2. I want to watch and understand the intro to programing video and start that practice and the drills. I may have an issue with my console or it is user error, I need to figure that out before I dive in.
3. I want to get my second and third learn to learns done this weekend so I can finish up the soft skills. I want to ensure that I do them on effective things that actually add value for me. Thinking of doing one on page placement (grid and flex) and one on programming.
4. Get myself to a point where I am confident in what I have been working on and if I am not, figure out what I need to do over the weekend.  


Refection on goals for the day: Oct 10/20
Goal one: I did a good job with this. Luckily I did not make many mistakes, most of them were formatting. This is important and kind of funny because I am a crazy person when it come to being organized I am usually a crazy person about it. I think I was just too excited and trying to get through it all, and I should not be doing that.
Sloppy work is a problem and definitely one I do not want to have. I also did a good job of understanding why not to use breaks for formatting and through doing so, understood a lot more about grid than I had before. Grid was hard for me because I followed it in a tutorial for the pre-course work and did not fully comprehend what I was doing which made me even more confused when I did try to do it.

Goal two: Java and those things are difficult for me,
