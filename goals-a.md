SMART Goals for 10/19/17 Today I want to accomplish a few things:
Goal 1: Ensure all my drills I submitted are 100% correct and I understand where I messed up and the reason what I did was incorrect by the end of the day. If I do not understand this, I will reach out for help.

Goal 2: My second goal is to plan all the meetups that I currently access to I think would be beneficial to me for the next month.

Goal 3: Work diligently on all of the soft skills work. Keep my mind focused and complete the drills by EoD. If this requires work after the mentor night, do it. Have all of these drills understood, notes taken and accomplished. This includes updating previous drills if need be.

Refection on goals for the day: Oct 10/19
I did not accomplish these. The major thing that did not go well was everything, but what did go well I think is how I tried to handle it and handle myself.  Paired with some super unfortunate luck by way of deleting my user and computer and losing everything I was overwhelmed and upset and needed to disengage. I need to re-do these goals for Friday 10/20. I did immediately go into solve mode and have my weekend structured around figuring it all out and ensuring I can start with a clean slate and ready on Monday. Having something this bad happen this early was good for me. I am happy that I had to get myself back into mitigating really stressful things and be reminded that being negative will not help and taking a break and disengaging is okay. Work done in a bad mindset is bad work. That is something I have difficulty with.
