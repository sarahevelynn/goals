SMART for 10/20  Today I want to accomplish a few things:
Goal 1: Ensure all my drills I submitted are 100% correct and I understand where I messed up and the reason what I did was incorrect by the end of the day. If I do not understand this, I will reach out for help.

Goal 2: My second goal is to plan all the meetups that I currently access to I think would be beneficial to me for the next month.

Goal 3: Work diligently on all of the soft skills work. Keep my mind focused and complete the drills by EoD. If this requires work after the mentor night, do it. Have all of these drills understood, notes taken and accomplished. This includes updating previous drills if need be.

Goal 4: Over the weekend I want to fix my computer problem. This means staying calm, cool and collected when at the store and trying to best explain everything that happened. This means accepting the outcome of whatever happens and moving on from it. This also means taking it as a learning experience, and continuing to try to laugh about it.

Refection on goals for the day: Oct 10/20
I have done relatively well accomplishing these goals. I have let myself get a little too into wanting to do the "real" drills and have let my soft skills drills I have left to do fall to the way side. Getting motivated for these is hard for me because I am a writer and very good with time management, and I feel like they're a waste of time. But they are important. I need to start developing good habits when it comes to doing this kind of work, not the work I am used to. Also not all of the work all of the time is going to be as great and exciting and awesome as the creation of the other drills, and that does not mean that what those are for are not equally important.
I have re-submitted all of my other other drills that were incorrect and re-went through all of them to ensure I really know CLI and what I am doing. I am proud of myself for practicing and staying with that. I have passed all of the ones I have submitted and gotten graded so far. Lets hope my hours of html also paid off!
I did get my computer situation solved but still have to do a lot of setup, I want to do that tonight and be able to have my machine back and ready for how I like it so I don't need to waste anymore time on it.
I also have done a horrible job with meetups. Getting into the swing of things with learning and applying myself for 8 hours straight has been difficult. I am hoping this is my last adjustment week where I am sleeping a ton and I have been acclimated. I want to go through the meetup schedule this week and plan out my next month with them. This way I can commit to them and plan around it.
